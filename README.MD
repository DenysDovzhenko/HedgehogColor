# HedgehogColor

Imagine that you have a meadow where hedgehogs are playing. They are colored in three different colors - red, green, and blue (RGB)

One day, two hedgehogs of different colors meet by chance, and then they both change their color to the opposite, third color. This ability fascinated the hedgehogs, and they agreed to plan their meetings so that they could all become the same color.
The task of the program, or rather objects of the `Playground` class, is to determine the most effective meeting plan for hedgehogs.
To start using program you can simply create `Playground` instance and launch `PlanMeetings()` public method.
